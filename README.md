# Index Coop Analytics

### Analytics Working Group

Welcome! This repository supports the Index Coop Analytics Working Group (AWG). The [Index Coop](https://discord.gg/4XBGHBKxdU) is a product-focused DAO building crypto index products for specific market segments. AWG supports all initiatives across the Index Coop: product, treasury, growth, governance, liquidity, and metrics. 

The Coop is growing rapidly since launching the first index product, DPI, in Fall 2020. The analytics capabilities within the Coop must scale in order to support the Coop through this rapid growth. The Coop prides itself on being data-driven. Data is one of the life-bloods of efficient collaboration and decision making within a DAO. The Coop must operate from a foundation of facts and truth, and the AWG will work to make sure that is always the case.

### Contributing

New contributors are always welcome. Impactful contributions will be rewarded by the Index Coop (in the form of INDEX token). A major reason for this repoâ€™s existence is the help manage the contributions from many people in an efficient and transparent way.

Please read through CONTRIBUTINY for a full primer on how to start contributing, as well as the organization of the project.

### Regarding DAO Analytics

We are on the forefront of learning how to best support a DAO with data and analytics. DAO analytics groups are not common, but we have a belief that analytics can be a functional advantage for a DAO. The AWG is viewed as an iterative process to learn how to best support the DAO.
